## What is BehindTheSite?

BehindTheSite is a Chrome extension that shows you transparency information about the websites you visit:

- **Who owns them** - Major shareholders like BlackRock, Vanguard, or founders
- **Where they're from** - Country of origin and headquarters
- **What to watch for** - Flags like "Chinese Owned", "Oil Industry", "Poor Labor Practices"

The extension is personalized to your values. During onboarding, you tell us what you care about (environment, privacy, labor rights, etc.) and we show you relevant information as you browse.

## Privacy
